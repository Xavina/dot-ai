ðŸ›‘ CRITICAL: First, present ALL available solutions to the user with their scores and descriptions. NEVER automatically choose - always ask the user to choose their preferred approach before proceeding with configuration questions.

Then ask configuration questions one by one, starting with required fields. Wait for each answer before asking the next question. After collecting all required answers, ask if the user wants to configure optional settings.

Once you have the user's solution choice and required information, use the enhance_solution tool with the selected solution and collected answers to generate the final manifest.
