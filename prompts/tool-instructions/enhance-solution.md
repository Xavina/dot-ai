# Enhance Solution Tool - User Interaction Requirements

## ðŸ”§ Solution Enhancement with AI

Customize, optimize, modify, or enhance existing deployment solutions with AI-powered improvements.

### âœ… REQUIRED WORKFLOW:
1. Ensure you have a complete solution object from the recommend tool
2. The solution must include a `questions.open.answer` field with user requirements
3. Use the entire solution object as JSON string in the "solution_data" parameter

### Input Requirements:

**ðŸ“‹ Solution Data Structure:**
The solution_data parameter must be a JSON string containing:
- Complete solution object from recommend tool
- User's response in `questions.open.answer` field
- All original solution metadata (type, score, description, etc.)

**Example Solution Data:**
```json
{
  "type": "Deployment",
  "score": 0.95,
  "description": "Standard Kubernetes deployment for web applications",
  "questions": {
    "open": {
      "question": "Any specific requirements?",
      "answer": "Need high availability with 3 replicas and health checks"
    }
  }
}
```
