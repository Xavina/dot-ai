The KubectlConfig interface supports essential parameters (context, namespace, kubeconfig path, timeout) and the implementation follows a logical priority system for kubeconfig path resolution.\n\nKey strengths include clean separation of concerns between command building and execution, proper timeout handling, and consistent integration across all discovery methods. The executeKubectl method appropriately distinguishes between stderr warnings and actual errors while providing specific feedback for missing kubectl binaries.\n\nHowever, the current implementation has room for improvement in validation and error handling. Context validation is missing - the system doesn't verify if specified contexts actually exist in the kubeconfig before attempting to use them. Authentication method detection is absent, making it difficult to provide targeted guidance when auth fails. Error messages for authentication failures are generic and don't help users understand the specific issue or resolution steps.\n\nFor immediate priorities, the existing implementation is sufficient for basic discovery operations. The simple interface design aligns well with keeping complexity low while focusing on core functionality.

Complex user intents and context\n   - Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) like Crossplane Compositions\n   - Semantic relationships between concepts\n   - Resource interdependencies\n\n3. **CRD Blindness**: Example analysis showed Crossplane Compositions (powerful infrastructure-as-code resources) would score 0 points for all intents, despite being ideal for production workloads\n\n4. **No Composition Intelligence**: Cannot suggest complete solutions or understand that \"scalable web app\" needs multiple complementary resources working together\n\n**ENHANCEMENT DECISION: AI-Powered Resource Evaluation**\n\nWe've decided to enhance the ResourceRanker with **Anthropic SDK integration** to create an intelligent agent that:\n\n**Key Capabilities:**\n- **Dynamic reasoning** about all available cluster resources\n- **Contextual understanding** of complex user intents\n- **Cluster-aware analysis** of what's actually available\n- **Resource relationship modeling** for complete solutions\n- **CRD intelligence** - can understand any custom resource by analyzing its schema\n- **Combination recommendations** - suggests resource stacks, not just individual resources\n\n**Architecture Approach:**\n- Keep current rule-based system as fallback/baseline\n- Add AI-enhanced evaluation using existing Claude integration\n- Provide confidence scores to indicate AI vs. rule-based recommendations\n- Support both individual resource ranking and complete solution recommendations\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Handles complex scenarios like Crossplane Compositions intelligently\n- Adapts to any cluster configuration and available CRDs\n- Understands user intent semantically, not just through keywords\n- Can recommend complete, deployable solutions\n- Learns and improves recommendations over time\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Design AI-enhanced ResourceRanker architecture\n- Integrate with existing Claude SDK infrastructure\n- Implement cluster resource discovery and AI evaluation\n- Enhance to recommend resource combinations/stacks\n- Add comprehensive testing for AI-powered scenarios\n\nThis represents a significant evolution from simple keyword matching to intelligent, context-aware resource recommendation that can handle the full complexity of modern Kubernetes environments.\n</info added on 2025-06-28T22:49:27.472Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-28T23:40:13.440Z>\n**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED -

Identified and resolved four critical issues: missing npm script error where CI was calling non-existent 'npm run ci:validate', redundant workflows with duplicate security audits between ci.yml and security.yml, inefficient Node.js matrix testing against both 18.x and 20.x versions, and test expectations mismatch for old workflow structure.\n\nImplemented solutions include consolidating ci.yml and security.yml into single comprehensive workflow, replacing missing ci:validate script with proper ci:security audit, removing Node matrix to use single Node.js 20.x LTS for approximately 50% faster CI runtime, and updating infrastructure tests to expect consolidated structure.\n\nFinal workflow structure features CI Pipeline & Security with test job handling lint, build, test, and security audit, security job running CodeQL static analysis, triggers on push to main/develop and PRs to main, with runtime reduced from approximately 2.5 minutes to 1.3 minutes.\n\nCurrent status shows all 192 tests passing locally, CI workflow passing on GitHub (run #15944237437), both test and security analysis jobs completing successfully, and no remaining workflow failures or missing scripts. The CI/CD pipeline is now optimized, consolidated, and fully functional.\n</info added on 2025-06-28T12:43:47.737Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-28T12:46:17.214Z>\n**TASK SCOPE RESET - CORRECTING MISALIGNED CONTENT**\n\nPrevious content incorrectly focused on CI/CD workflow implementation, which does not align with this subtask's actual purpose. Resetting to proper scope.\n\n**ACTUAL TASK: Build PolicyRule interface with validation functions**\n\nThis subtask implements the core policy rule representation system for the plain English policy parser:\n\n**Required Components:**\n- TypeScript interfaces for policy rule types including RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), NetworkPolicy, PodSecurityPolicy, SecurityContext, and custom policy definitions\n- Validation functions for each policy category with type checking, constraint validation, and rule consistency verification\n- Rule representation logic that converts structured policy data into intermediate format suitable for plain English conversion\n- Integration points with parser engine including rule ingestion interface, validation pipeline hooks, and output formatting for natural language generation\n\n**Implementation Approach:**\nCore PolicyRule interface will define common properties (id, type, description, constraints, metadata) with specialized interfaces extending base for each policy type. Validation functions will implement category-specific logic for rule integrity checking. Rule representation will provide standardized format for parser engine consumption.\n\n**Status:** Pending implementation - core functionality required before parser engine integration can proceed.\n\n**Priority:** High - foundational component for policy parser functionality.\n</info added on 2025-06-28T12:46:17.214Z>",

File naming: `sol_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS_randomhex.json`. Each file contains complete solution + questions + intent + empty answers structure for future manipulation.\n\n2. **Response Format Change**: Return only data needed to choose a solution - include solutionId, type, score, description, primaryResources, reasons, and analysis. Remove questions from response (they'll be returned by chooseSolution). Add workflow guidance with nextAction field.\n\n3. **Solution Limit**: Up to 5 solutions when applicable, but respect quality thresholds - don't propose bad solutions just to reach 5.\n\n4. **Configuration**: Support both CLI parameter `--session-dir` and environment variable `APP_AGENT_SESSION_DIR`. CLI parameter takes precedence if both are set. Fail fast if directory doesn't exist or isn't writable.\n\n5. **File Structure**: Flat directory structure (no subdirectories). Each solution file is self-contained with complete context.\n\n6. **Workflow Simplification**: Eliminates session concept entirely. Workflow becomes: recommend(intent) → chooseSolution(solutionId) → answerQuestion(solutionId, answers).\n\nThis design makes each solution independently workable and eliminates the complexity of session management while providing all necessary data for decision-making.\n</info added on 2025-07-01T13:57:03.441Z>",

Maintain data integrity with atomic file operations\n   - Preserve existing solution data and metadata\n\n3. **Return Additional Questions**:\n   - Determine what questions still need answers\n   - Return remaining questions to calling agent/person\n   - Continue iterative loop until completion\n\n4. **Handle Completion**:\n   - Recognize when all required questions are answered\n   - End loop with \"No additional answers needed\" or similar status\n   - Prepare solution data for handoff to Task 7 (manifest generation)\n\n**Reference Implementation Patterns:**\n- Apply all architectural patterns established in chooseSolution (subtask 20.3)\n- Use same response format, error handling, file operations, and agent guidance approaches\n- Reference legacy enhance_solution code (src/legacy/) for validation logic\n\n**Detailed Design Decision Point**:\nWhen starting this subtask, conduct comprehensive design session to determine:\n- Progressive disclosure strategy (required → optional → advanced flow)\n- Answer validation and error handling specifics  \n- Completion criteria and exit conditions\n- Integration approach with Task 7 manifest generation\n- File update and concurrency handling details\n\nThis tool completes the stateful conversation workflow, replacing the JSON-heavy enhance_solution approach with an agent-friendly iterative dialogue system.\n<info added on 2025-07-01T16:09:12.977Z>\n**FINAL DESIGN DECISIONS IMPLEMENTED:**\n\n**Core Architecture Confirmed:**\n- Input parameters: solutionId (required), sessionDir (required), answers (object), done (optional boolean)\n- Iterative conversation loop with state persistence directly in solution JSON file\n- Seamless enhancement integration when open question is answered\n\n**Implementation Specifications:**\n\n1. **Iterative Loop Implementation:**\n   - Merge incoming answers with existing solution data using object spread/assign\n   - Filter response questions by checking if answer keys already exist in solution\n   - Return only unanswered questions to maintain natural conversation flow\n   - Each iteration builds upon previous state without data loss\n\n2. **Completion Flow Design:**\n   - When done=true parameter received: return structured open question object\n   - Open question text: \"Is there anything else about your requirements or constraints that would help us better configure this solution for your needs?\"\n   - Signals transition from structured to free-form input phase\n\n3. **Critical Enhancement Integration:**\n   - When open question receives answer: immediately trigger enhancement analysis within answerQuestion tool\n   - Apply legacy enhancement workflow: resource analysis → solution enhancement → outcome determination\n   - Three possible outcomes: enhance_existing (modify solution in-place), add_resources (append new resources), capability_gap (return error with explanation)\n   - Enhancement happens atomically within same tool call - no separate tool required\n\n4. **File Operation Strategy:**\n   - Use atomic write pattern: write to temporary file, then rename to target\n   - Read current solution JSON → merge answers → apply enhancement if triggered → write enhanced result\n   - Preserve all existing solution metadata, configuration, and structure during updates\n\n5. **Response Format Standardization:**\n   - Standard response: array of remaining unanswered question objects\n   - Done signal response: single open question object with specific structure\n   - Enhanced completion: success confirmation with enhanced solution summary\n   - Error response: capability gap details with specific missing capabilities\n   - All responses include solutionId for workflow continuity\n\n6. **Legacy Code Integration Points:**\n   - Reference src/legacy/core/solution-enhancer.ts for enhancement logic patterns\n   -

Validate answers against question schemas and constraints\n   - Validate sessionId exists and solution file is accessible\n\n2. **Update Solution JSON**:\n   - Populate question.answer fields in solution file with validated answers\n   - Use atomic file operations for data integrity\n   - Preserve all existing solution data and metadata\n\n3. **Return Remaining Questions**:\n   - Return array of unanswered questions from required/basic/advanced categories\n   - Filter questions by checking presence of question.answer fields\n   - Maintain iterative conversation flow until all questions answered\n\n4. **Handle Open Question**:\n   - When done=true parameter received, save open question answer to solution file\n   -

Documentation Parser:\n   - Implement a parser that can extract executable commands, code blocks, and configuration examples from Markdown files (README.md, docs/*.md).\n   - Use a library like 'marked' to parse Markdown and identify code blocks.\n   - Create a data structure to store extracted code snippets with their context (file, line number, surrounding text).\n\n2. Test Environment Setup:\n   - Implement a TestEnvironment class that can create isolated environments for each documentation scenario.\n   - Use Docker containers or virtual environments to ensure clean, isolated test execution.\n   - Implement methods to initialize environments with necessary dependencies based on documentation context.\n\n3. Command Execution and Validation:\n   - Create an ExecutionEngine class that can run extracted commands in the isolated environments.\n   - Implement output capture and comparison against expected results mentioned in documentation.\n   - Handle different types of validations: exit codes, stdout/stderr content, file system changes.\n\n4. Report Generation:\n   - Implement a ReportGenerator class that creates detailed test reports.\n   - Include pass/fail status for each documentation section, with specific details on failures.\n   - Generate both human-readable (HTML/Markdown) and machine-parseable (JSON) report formats.\n\n5. CI/CD Integration:\n   - Create a GitHub Action or similar CI/CD workflow file that runs the documentation tests on each push or pull request.\n   - Implement failure conditions that prevent merging if documentation tests fail.\n\n6. Test Modes:\n   - Implement different test modes:\n     a) Syntax validation: Check if code blocks are syntactically correct without full execution.\n     b) Full execution: Run all commands and validate outputs.\n     c) Environment-specific tests: Allow specifying which tests to run based on available environments.\n\n7. Configuration:\n   - Create a configuration file (doctest.config.json) to specify test parameters, ignored files/sections, and environment setups.\n\n8. Main CLI Interface:\n   - Implement a command-line interface (bin/doctest.js) that allows running tests with various options.\n   - Include commands for running all tests, specific files, or test modes.\n\n**Rationale for Deferral:**\nWhile this feature would significantly enhance documentation quality and reduce maintenance overhead, it represents an advanced quality assurance tool that extends beyond the essential functionality needed for v1 release. The core v1 focus should remain on delivering fundamental features that provide immediate value to users.\n\n**Future Considerations:**\n- This feature will be prioritized in post-v1 development cycles\n- Implementation will be tracked in a separate PRD with detailed specifications\n- The system design should remain modular and extensible to support future additions of new documentation formats or test types",

Unit Tests:\n   - Write unit tests for each class (DocTester, TestEnvironment, ExecutionEngine, ReportGenerator) using a testing framework like Jest.\n   - Test parsing functionality with various Markdown inputs.\n   - Mock command execution to test different scenarios (success, failure, timeout).\n\n2. Integration Tests:\n   - Create a set of test documentation files with known commands and expected outputs.\n   - Run the full documentation testing process on these files and verify correct identification, execution, and reporting.\n   - Test different configuration options and test modes.\n\n3. Environment Tests:\n   - Verify that isolated test environments are correctly created and destroyed.\n   - Test with different environment types (Docker, virtual env) if supported.\n\n4. CI/CD Tests:\n   - Set up a test repository with sample documentation.\n   - Verify that the CI/CD integration correctly runs tests and reports results.\n   - Test both passing and failing scenarios to ensure proper merge prevention.\n\n5. Performance Tests:\n   - Measure execution time for large documentation sets.\n   - Ensure reasonable performance for projects with extensive documentation.\n\n6. Edge Case Tests:\n   - Test with malformed Markdown, extremely long code blocks, and unusual characters.\n   - Verify handling of timeouts, crashes, and other execution failures.\n\n7. Usability Testing:\n   - Have team members use the CLI interface and review generated reports.\n   - Gather feedback on usability and clarity of output.\n\n8. Regression Testing:\n   - Maintain a suite of documentation files that cover various scenarios.\n   - Run this suite before each release to catch potential regressions.\n\n9. Cross-platform Testing:\n   - Verify functionality on different operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows).\n\n10. Security Testing:\n    - Ensure that executed commands cannot escape the isolated environment.\n    - Verify that sensitive information is not leaked in reports or logs.\n\n**Note:** This testing strategy will be refined and implemented when the task is moved from cancelled status to active development in the future PRD.",
