# Product Requirements Document: App-Agent - Kubernetes Application Management System

## Executive Summary

App-Agent is a dual-mode AI-powered agent for deploying applications to ANY Kubernetes cluster through dynamic discovery. It eliminates platform lock-in by discovering available resources at runtime and provides both CLI and MCP (Model Context Protocol) interfaces for maximum flexibility.

## Product Vision

**Core Mission**: Enable seamless application deployment to any Kubernetes cluster without hardcoded platform assumptions, powered by AI intelligence that learns and adapts.

**Key Value Propositions**:
- Works with ANY Kubernetes cluster (GKE, EKS, AKS, vanilla, custom platforms)
- Discovers and utilizes ANY available resources (CRDs, core K8s, custom abstractions)
- Learns from deployments to improve future recommendations
- Dual-mode operation: standalone CLI + MCP server for agent integration
- Plain English governance without complex YAML policies

## Target Users

### Secondary Users
1. **Developers**: Deploying applications without deep Kubernetes knowledge
2. **Site Reliability Engineers**: Troubleshooting deployment issues
3. **Security Engineers**: Enforcing governance policies

## Core Requirements

### 2. Dual-Mode Operation
**Requirement**: Provide identical intelligence through two distinct interfaces.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **CLI Mode**: Direct user interaction with conversational Q&A
- **MCP Mode**: Structured JSON responses for AI agent integration

- Support GitOps resources (ArgoCD Application, Flux HelmRelease)
- Support serverless resources (Knative Service, OpenFaaS Function)
- Support custom organizational CRDs
- Generate manifests from discovered schemas
- Validate manifests before deployment

### 4. Memory-Enhanced Learning
**Requirement**: Learn from deployments and apply lessons to future operations.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Store successful deployment patterns in JSON files
- Record troubleshooting lessons from failures
- Apply learned patterns to similar future deployments
- Cluster fingerprinting for environment-specific lessons
- Configuration pattern recognition
- Networking and access pattern storage
- Integration with optional external memory systems

### 5. Plain English Governance
**Requirement**: Support organizational policies written in natural language.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Parse plain text policy files (no YAML required)
- Apply security, compliance, and resource policies
- Environment-specific rule enforcement
- Cost and resource limit validation
- Platform preference application
- Interactive policy violation handling
- Template-based policy starter sets

### 6. Comprehensive Testing Strategy
**Requirement**: Test-driven development with tests written alongside features.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Unit tests for discovery logic
- Integration tests for Kubernetes API interactions
- MCP function contract tests
- CLI interface tests
- Memory system tests
- Policy parsing and application tests
- End-to-end deployment tests
- Mock cluster testing capabilities

## Technical Requirements

### Core Technologies
- **Language**: TypeScript/JavaScript (unified codebase for both CLI and MCP)
- **AI Integration**: Claude Code SDK for shared core intelligence
- **Kubernetes**: Official JavaScript client library (@kubernetes/client-node)
- **MCP Protocol**: Standard MCP server implementation
- **CLI Distribution**: Standalone binary via Bun or pkg for easy distribution
- **Memory Storage**: JSON files with optional external integration
- **Testing**: Jest/Vitest with unified test suite for both modes

### Performance Requirements
- Cluster discovery: < 10 seconds for typical clusters
- Resource schema parsing: < 5 seconds per resource type
- Manifest generation: < 3 seconds
- Memory lesson retrieval: < 1 second
- Support clusters with 100+ CRDs

### Security Requirements
- Use user's existing kubectl configuration and permissions
- No credential storage in memory files
- Secure handling of generated manifests
- Policy compliance verification
- Audit logging for governance violations

## MCP Function Specifications

### Required Functions
1. **create_application**: Initialize deployment workflow with discovery
2. **continue_workflow**: Progress workflow based on user input
3. **deploy_application**: Execute deployment with generated manifests
4. **get_deployment_status**: Monitor deployment progress and results

### Function Requirements
- JSON schema validation for all inputs/outputs
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Workflow state management
- Progress tracking and guidance
- Integration with memory system

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- Successfully deploy to 5+ different cluster types
- Support 20+ different CRD types without code changes
