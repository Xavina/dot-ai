# App-Agent

**Intelligent Kubernetes deployment made simple**

Discover what's available in your cluster and get AI-powered recommendations for deploying your applications using the best resources for your needs.

## What is App-Agent?

App-Agent analyzes your Kubernetes cluster to understand what resources and operators are available, then uses AI to recommend the optimal way to deploy your applications. Whether you have a basic cluster or one with advanced operators like Crossplane or ArgoCD, App-Agent adapts to work with what you have.

## Key Benefits

üîç **Cluster-Aware**: Automatically discovers your cluster's capabilities  
ü§ñ **AI-Powered**: Get intelligent deployment recommendations  
‚ö° **Zero Configuration**: Works with any Kubernetes cluster out of the box  
üîß **Operator-Friendly**: Leverages custom operators when available  
üìù **Interactive**: Asks the right questions to refine your deployment

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/your-org/app-agent.git
cd app-agent
npm install && npm run build
```

### Get Recommendations

```bash
# Discover what's in your cluster
node dist/cli.js discover

# Get AI recommendations for your application
node dist/cli.js recommend --intent "deploy a web application with database"

# Interactive deployment workflow available via MCP tools
# See docs/API.md for MCP integration examples
```

### Set up AI Features (Optional)

For AI-powered recommendations, add your Claude API key:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## How It Works

### 1. Discover Your Cluster
App-Agent scans your cluster to find all available resources - both standard Kubernetes resources and custom resources from operators.

```bash
node dist/cli.js discover
# Shows: Deployments, Services, Pods, AppClaims, CloudRun, etc.
```

### 2. Get AI Recommendations  
Describe what you want to deploy and get intelligent recommendations based on what's actually available in your cluster.

```bash
node dist/cli.js recommend --intent "deploy a web application that can scale"
# Returns: Ranked solutions using your cluster's best resources
```

### 3. Interactive Deployment
Use MCP tools for conversational deployment workflow with progressive question answering.

```bash
# Via MCP server integration (recommended)
npm run mcp:start
# Interactive workflow: recommend ‚Üí chooseSolution ‚Üí answerQuestion ‚Üí generateManifests
```

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. See what's available in your cluster
node dist/cli.js discover --output table

# 2. Start MCP server for interactive deployment
npm run mcp:start

# 3. Use MCP tools for conversational workflow:
#    - recommend: Get AI-powered deployment recommendations
#    - chooseSolution: Select your preferred solution
#    - answerQuestion: Answer configuration questions progressively
#    - generateManifests: Generate final Kubernetes YAML

# 4. Deploy the generated manifests
kubectl apply -f generated-manifests.yaml
```

## Available Commands

```bash
# Discovery commands
app-agent discover [--kubeconfig PATH] [--output FORMAT]
app-agent explain RESOURCE [--field FIELD]
app-agent fingerprint [--detailed]

# AI-powered recommendations
app-agent recommend --intent "DESCRIPTION" [--output FORMAT]
# Note: Interactive deployment via MCP tools (see MCP Server section)

# Resource management  
app-agent apply CONFIG [--namespace NS]
app-agent delete RESOURCE [--all]

# Utility commands
app-agent version
app-agent help [COMMAND]
```

## Integration Options

### MCP Server
Use App-Agent as an MCP server for integration with AI tools and IDEs:

```bash
npm run mcp:start
# Compatible with Cursor, Claude Code, and other MCP-enabled tools
```

### Programmatic Usage
See the [API Documentation](docs/API.md) for TypeScript integration examples.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+**
- **kubectl** configured with cluster access
- **Claude API key** (optional, for AI features)

## Configuration

App-Agent automatically finds your kubeconfig file:
1. Custom path via `--kubeconfig` flag
2. `KUBECONFIG` environment variable  
3. Default `~/.kube/config`

```bash
# Optional: Custom kubeconfig location
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/your/kubeconfig.yaml

# Optional: Claude AI API key (for AI features)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
